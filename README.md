A Simple Node.js Application Deployment Example


## Overview of the CI/CD Pipeline
The video demonstrates the creation of an end-to-end Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with the following steps:

### **Pipeline Steps**
1. **Code Build and Vulnerability Checks**
   - Jenkins setup for GitHub integration.
   - Running unit tests and scanning for vulnerabilities using SonarQube.
2. **Docker Integration**
   - Building Docker images.
   - Pushing images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
3. **Deployment to AWS**
   - Deploying Docker images to Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate.

---

## Jenkins Configuration and GitHub Integration
- **Setting up Jenkins**: Configuring GitHub credentials and defining pipeline stages using a `Jenkinsfile`.
- **Running Tests**: Unit tests with npm and code quality analysis with SonarQube.

---

## Docker Integration and Deployment
- **Building Docker Images**: Creating lightweight Docker images using Alpine.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Using Trivy to scan Docker images.
- **AWS Integration**:
  - Pushing Docker images to AWS ECR.
  - Deploying to AWS ECS using Fargate.

---

## AWS ECS Deployment
1. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Creating ECS clusters and services.
   - Configuring load balancers and security groups.
2. **Application Management**:
   - Deploying and managing containerized applications.
   - Monitoring performance and ensuring public accessibility.
3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Deleting unused resources to prevent unnecessary expenses.

---

## Resource Cleanup
To maintain cost efficiency, ensure proper deletion of:
- Target groups
- Load balancers
- ECS clusters
- Any associated AWS resources.

---

## Conclusion
This guide empowers developers with a streamlined CI/CD pipeline setup. By combining Jenkins, Docker, and AWS ECS, you can build, test, and deploy applications effectively while maintaining high-quality standards and cost efficiency.
